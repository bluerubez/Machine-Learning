Machine-Learning
These are hands-on Machine Learning Projects view-able as IPython notebooks and RStudio notebooks !  

It is very easy to view these in notebook form, just:

1. Navigate to the raw file you want to view
2. Copy the address of the raw file
3. Paste the address into the search bar on nbviewer homepage at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/ then hit <enter>
